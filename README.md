Background
Churn prediction is a crucial task for businesses to identify customers who are likely to leave a service or product. In the context of this project, churn customers refer to GitHub users who may discontinue their engagement with the platform. To tackle this challenge, we employ the Random Forest and SVM algorithms to develop an effective churn prediction model.

The Random Forest algorithm utilizes an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions. By combining the knowledge of multiple trees, this algorithm achieves high accuracy and robustness. SVM, on the other hand, is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It aims to find an optimal hyperplane that separates different classes with maximum margin.

Installation
To run the churn prediction model and deploy it on Streamlit, follow the steps below:

Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/churn-customer-prediction.git
cd churn-customer-prediction
Create a virtual environment and activate it (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
Install the required dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the churn prediction model and interact with it on Streamlit, follow these steps:

Run the Streamlit application:

arduino
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
The application will start running locally, and you can access it through your web browser at http://localhost:8501.

Use the provided input fields to enter the relevant customer information, such as activity metrics, subscription details, etc.

Click the "Predict" button to obtain the churn prediction for the given customer.

Model Training
The code for training the churn prediction model using Random Forest and SVM can be found in the train_model.ipynb notebook. The notebook provides a step-by-step explanation of the training process, including data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

Model Deployment
The churn prediction model has been deployed on Streamlit to provide a user-friendly interface for churn predictions. The app.py file contains the Streamlit application code that loads the trained model and enables user interaction through a web interface.
